The project “Covid-19 Dashboard” focuses on visualizing global COVID-19 data using Python’s powerful libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The project imports real-world COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset and presents it through various charts including bar graphs, scatter plots, and a pie chart.
These visualizations make it easier to understand the global spread of COVID-19, identify the most affected countries, and observe the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths.
This project demonstrates how data visualization helps transform raw data into meaningful insights.
